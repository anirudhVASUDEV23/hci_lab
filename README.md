# **Interactive Design Layout for Budget App**

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on developing an **interactive design layout** for the assigned application domain, incorporating various **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles**. The design aims to **enhance usability** by applying key concepts such as:
- **Shneidermanâ€™s Design Principles**
- **Nielsenâ€™s Usability Heuristics**
- **Classical Design Laws** (Vital Few, Law of Learning, Mental Models, Closure, etc.)
- **Asimovâ€™s Laws**
- **Flexibility, Robustness, Learnability, Recency, and Serial Position Effect**
- **The 80-20 Rule (Pareto Principle) in HCI**

The final submission includes **wireframes, screenshots, and explanations** of how these HCI principles were implemented.

## **Features & Design Considerations**
### ðŸ”¹ **Usability Enhancements**
- **User-Centric Layout:** Ensures an intuitive experience by following Mental Models.
- **Learnability & Flexibility:** The interface adapts to both new and experienced users.
- **Error Prevention & Feedback:** Implements clear messages and confirmation dialogs.

### ðŸ”¹ **HCI Principles Applied**
| Concept | Application |
|---------|------------|
| **Shneidermanâ€™s Rules** | Ensures consistency, error handling, and user control |
| **Nielsenâ€™s Guidelines** | Improves visibility, error prevention, and help documentation |
| **Law of Learning** | Reduces cognitive load for easier learning |
| **Inverted Pyramid** | Presents crucial information first |
| **80-20 Rule** | Focuses on the most important features that impact usability |
